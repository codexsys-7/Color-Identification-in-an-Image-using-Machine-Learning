Color Recognition through OpenCV is a Simple but very effective Project which involves in identifying color on a particular thing, this is useful in various applications, especially for the people who are having difficulty in recognizing colors and for the blind people, if we add Text to Speech Library. In order to identify the colors, the model is trained on various colored images using KNN Classifier which is a popular Machine Learning Algorithm and whenever we pass a new image to the model it will try to predict that particular color by comparing the color code within its database whcih the model is trained and then it displays it on the Screen.
